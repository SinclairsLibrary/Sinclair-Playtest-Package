Peaceful people living in large communities, they value the art of craft, the beauty of nature, and the love shared around a fire. But peaceful and harmless are not the same, and one would be wise to know the difference before angering a Bovian.<br />Bovians are strong in body and heart. Bearing a strong sense of community overall, they tend to be friendly to outsiders as well as each other. Though mostly peaceful, their history is not without darkness; while minotaurs’ predisposition to violence gives a bad reputation to bovians around the world, these assumptions do not reflect reality in the slightest. Bovians tend to make fast friends and love nothing more than a good conversation about the wonders of nature.<br />If you want to play a character who is a gentle giant, loyal to a fault, and a team player in a party of adventurers, with a comb</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Like to make friends, and perhaps give a little too much of yourself to keep them happy.</li>\n<li>Grow your own food or craft things out of glass for yourself and your friends.</li>\n<li> Have features or fur colorations similar to those of bovines.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are intimidated by your stature or afraid of your strength.</li>\n<li>Assume you’re a vegetarian, farm all the time, or use your strength to get your way.</li>\n<li>Think of you as a lowly beast of burden, or an overly friendly fool.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Bovians are tall and powerful, with thick builds and fur of various natural shades and patterns. They usually sport small horns and hoofed feet. With the exception of the much smaller Anoa, the shortest bovian tends to be around 6 feet, with many growing to about 8 feet. Their clothing tends to favor natural materials and incorporate their famed glasswork, in which they take great pride.<br />Bovians reach physical maturity around the age of 15, which is often accompanied by a massive celebration. Outsiders rarely observe any obvious difference in the lifestyle of a bovian after this milestone. A typical bovian lives to around 100 years old.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The bovian people have a largely peaceful history, never conquering or holding an empire and eschewing dreams of world conquest, albeit with one notable exception (see The Great Conquest, below). Today bovians cling to the same qualities of peace and loyalty, with an added sense of community, and only rarely do they wish harm upon each other.</p>\n<p>Living in communal halls with plenty of space and easy access to the exterior, it is not uncommon for them to live the majority of their lives outside, only coming indoors to shelter from the weather. Bovians share a deep love of glassworking, and their artisans are widely considered to be masters at the art of infusing magic into glass. It is not unusual to see their cunning glasswork incorporated into their clothing, tools, and even architecture. Chief amongst such infusions are the remarkable stained glass windows which feature prominently in their buildings, casting light in wondrous new ways.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Despite their imposing stature, bovians tend to be a<br />peaceful people, naturally happy and benevolent. They<br />don’t like to be restricted or restrained too much, whether<br />the binds be literal, legal, or metaphoric. As such, many<br />tend to be neutral good or chaotic good.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Religiously, bovians favor deities that venerate nature<br />and the values of freedom and community. As such,<br />gods of nature tend to feature prominently. Their love<br />of artistry frequently inspires reverence for gods of<br />beauty and crafting.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea.
