This can be as simple as communicating efficiently, or as convoluted as devising elaborate schemes and executing complex martial maneuvers in tandem. While many adventurers assist their fellow party members by contributing their solo skills, some take team synergy a step further. Teamwork feats grant shared benefits to adventurers who train together.</p><p>Teamwork feats are class, general, or skill feats, but always involve two or more actors and possess an added Teamwork entry. This Teamwork entry lists an added benefit applicable if each other involved actor also possesses that specific feat; such allies are referred to as “teammates”. Teamwork feats with the class trait can be taken by any class—including via class feats granted by multiclass archetype feats, such as the fighter archetype’s Basic Maneuver—and gain the class trait associated with the appropriate class.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Teamwork Feats List","type":"text","_id":"YbsFWVX7nfBWenzt","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.RPfFm4qtHdqrQeKz]{Banter}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.O3E2AdCDS5GWVWyp]{Behind Me}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.iKJ7K6TBILQhlGbC]{Blended Spell}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.QPlsAehaZfvBVZjj]{Charging Assault}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.ICrmvD6LKBwTO6IR]{Coordinated Guard}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.P79yttpPqnJyeHho]{Distant Shield}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.GlIEkPHv6b7FPhGg]{Get Back!}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.54O3MouegtghAnlX]{Helpful Redirection}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.ceqUd6GC9j2RFDGe]{High and Low}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.fKXBXvWDU5etOK43]{Impart Shield}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.KyN4o2lU2jSHC4HB]{Many Hands Make Light Work}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.xNK7UURCo81IDtla]{Pincushion}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.FxyEW1l1qCzlZ130]{Redirect Shot}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.zxuAZ9w1Ag6Xn1UQ]{Saving Hand}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.0tnvHKf7eCG7Z6gn]{Slice and Dice}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.A52t3sYXa8wpJrg2]{Tandem Climbing}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.to3FW8lJqio9s6E6]{Terrifying Emphasis}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.kySXTuqrneZ4zsRr]{Twist the Arm}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.4uSERVm9HyayxaKy]{Two-Handed Delivery}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.c4ohAlejdX3XzCBi]{Up You Get!}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.sinclairs-library-playtest.sinclairs-library-feats.ixiGjOKRVGO5IQZB]{Watch Your Step}</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"XvAQTyKnzb1d2fbp":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"the-laboratory","system":"pf2e","coreVersion":"10.291","systemVersion":"4.7.4"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.qbXcMbZErmn0dKij"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.7.4","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1676353430609,"modifiedTime":1676836248878,"lastModifiedBy":"XvAQTyKnzb1d2fbp"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"KVXERbEmYU881KxP"}

Heroes defy the odds and get through insurmountable difficulties to complete their quest, even if it means staving off death for just a few more seconds. Last Stand actions allow you to do just that.</p><p>This variant rule introduces the Last Stand condition and trait. This condition is applied to any player character who has just been reduced to 0 hit points, before they fall unconscious. While in Last Stand, a character is prone, takes a -4 penalty to AC, can speak to an adjacent creature and can take one action at the start of their next turn, before rolling their first recovery check, after which they fall unconscious and become dying as normal. When a character gains the Last Stand condition, as usual for any creature reaching 0 hit points, they immediately move their initiative position accordingly. If a character with the Last Stand condition uses any action, reaction, or takes damage, they immediately fall unconscious and begin dying as normal. For any other purpose than the ability to take Last Stand actions, a character with the Last Stand condition is considered to be dying.</p><hr /><p>HANDLING LAST STAND AS A GM</p><p>Characters in Last Stand are often so wounded they could easily be confused with a dying or a dead character at first glance, and most intelligent creatures, unless extremely perceptive, would consider them out of the fight. When determining if you should strike a character during their Last Stand, consider the question the same way you would a dying character.</p><p>Alternatively, you can incorporate the slight distinction between Last Stand and Dying in the combat dynamic, by making an intelligent creature roll a perception check with a hard DC for its level when adjacent to a character in Last Stand, or by having the creature use the Seek action, like a wolf sniffing the body before deciding what to do next.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Actions","type":"text","_id":"eJ81ruXx7iG6yYCR","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Basic Actions</p><p>While in Last Stand, a character can only use three basic actions: Crawl, Seek, Recall Knowledge.
