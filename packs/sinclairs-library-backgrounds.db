Perhaps a close encounter with the unexpected, or a trek through terrible lands. Either way you came back from the experience changed, cursed. With this knowledge in mind, you can no longer live a normal life. Perhaps you will find the answers youâ€™re seeking on the road. Choose two ability boosts. One must be Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost. The curse has already started to grow within you, empowering you but also changing you. You gain a Consuming Curse Dedication of your choice as a bonus feat. You receive this feat at first level, even though it normally requires you to be a higher level.</span> </p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.837,"lastMigration":null},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"rare"},"boosts":{"0":{"value":[]},"1":{"value":[]}},"items":{},"trainedLore":"","trainedSkills":{"value":[]}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/background.svg","ownership":{"default":0,"XvAQTyKnzb1d2fbp":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.Bm3WLB79cqfYIaPM"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.11.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682971595018,"modifiedTime":1682973442538,"lastModifiedBy":"XvAQTyKnzb1d2fbp"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"ftgBxF8t7gCUXwnp"}
