As a group, you have a burrow Speed of 60 feet while navigating spaces that require fine control of your movement, or a travel Speed of 100 miles per hour over wider areas. Though blind, you and any creatures you bring with you have a general sense of direction, knowing which way is magnetic north (if applicable), which way is down, and how far away and in what direction the nearest surface is. While in this state, you do not need to breathe, cannot speak, and may communicate telepathically with the creatures you brought along with you. If at any point you or one of the creatures accompanying you exit the earth, the spell ends, placing all affected creatures in the nearest unoccupied space to the creature that exited first.</p>\n<p>If a creature breaks physical contact or the duration of the spell ends before a creature willingly exits the earth, they take [[/r 10d6[force]]] damage and are shunted out of the earth into the nearest unoccupied space. If a target of the spell is carrying a creature in an extradimensional space, the spell fails.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.819,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2023-02-07T14:16:36.647-06:00","version":{"schema":null,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.7.1"}}},"traits":{"value":["earth"],"rarity":"rare"},"level":{"value":7},"spellType":{"value":"attack"},"category":{"value":"spell"},"traditions":{"value":["primal"]},"school":{"value":"transmutation"},"components":{"focus":false,"material":false,"somatic":false,"verbal":false},"materials":{"value":""},"target":{"value":"you and up to 5 willing creatures touched"},"range":{"value":"Touch"},"area":null,"time":{"value":"1 minute"},"duration":{"value":""},"damage":{"value":{}},"save":{"value":"","basic":""},"sustained":{"value":false},"cost":{"value":""},"ability":{"value":""},"location":{"value":""},"hasCounteractCheck":{"value":false}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"8zmVfjhSMQSSGSg8":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.DPZR5iYHQjDRTEup"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.7.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1675800996651,"modifiedTime":1675802647312,"lastModifiedBy":"8zmVfjhSMQSSGSg8"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"aVwhSWJ0YRnOVj4q"}
