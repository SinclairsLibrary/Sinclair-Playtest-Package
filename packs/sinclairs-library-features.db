You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<h4><br />As you increase in level as a shaman, the magical link with your emblem grants you additional, more powerful spell slots. Your total number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast are shown in Table X–X: Shaman Spells per Day. Because of the way you draw magic from your emblem, you begin to lose lower-level spell slots once you reach 5th level. The maximum number of spell slots you get from the shaman class is four, starting when you reach 4th level. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Constitution, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Constitution modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in chapter 9 of the Core Rulebook under Spell Attack Rolls.</h4>\n<hr />\n<h4><strong>Heightening Spells</strong><br />When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells.

You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it doesn’t give you another spell slot, and vice versa.<br />You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you<br />get a spell slot (see Table X–X: Shaman Spells per Day), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1stlevel spell. At 3rd level, you add the first 2nd-level spell to your repertoire.<br />At 4th level, you gain your second 2nd-level spell and your spell repertoire reaches its maximum size of five spells. At 5th level, in addition to adding two 3rd-level spells to your repertoire, you lose your lowest level of spell slots. Any time you lose a level of spell slots, you lose two spells in your repertoire as well. These can come from spells you already know or out of the number of new spells you’re learning.

You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime. At 6th level and every even level thereafter, you can swap out any number of your spells for different spells of a level you can cast.
