The maximum number of spell slots you get from the shaman class is four, starting when you reach 4th level. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw).

You can deliver the spell even if its range is shorter than the range increment of your sling. When you enter Arcane Cascade and at the start of each of your turns while you're in that stance, if you have taken no actions with the move trait since the start of your last turn, the range increment of simple slings you wield increases by 10 feet and you gain resistance 1 to all damage until the start of your next turn or until you use an action with<br />the move trait. The range increment increase becomes 15 feet if you have weapon specialization and 20 feet if you have greater weapon specialization, and the resistance becomes 2 if you have weapon specialization and 3 if you have greater weapon specialization.</span> </p>\n<hr />\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">read and reload<br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Studious Spells</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">7th: </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">dispel magic</span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">; 11th: </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">slow</span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">; 13th: </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">stoneskin</span> </p>"},"source":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.827,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2023-02-28T00:34:55.734-06:00","version":{"schema":null,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.8.1"}}},"level":{"value":1},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common"},"featType":{"value":"classfeature"},"onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"location":null},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"8zmVfjhSMQSSGSg8":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.kOXuo4T43H2RjYeP"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.8.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677566095761,"modifiedTime":1677566204819,"lastModifiedBy":"8zmVfjhSMQSSGSg8"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"kq2aGVQVvN2msqIC"}
